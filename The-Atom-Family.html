                <h2 class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Silicon is a semiconducting element. It is used in the semiconductor industry,
                    in the creation of semicondutor products. What are semiconductor products?
                    Microprocessors, ASICs, Graphics Processing Units, Microcontrollers, etc.
                    Silicon is the foundation of the computation age, and here are it's
                    atomic properties.
                </p>
                <h2 class="subtitle">Electrons</h2>
                <p>
                    An electron is a negatively charged subatomic particle that surrounds an atom's
                    nucleus in different orbitals. Electrons allow for chemical bonds to form between elements,
                    and electricity. They also allow for atoms to be charged, also known as becoming an Ion.
                    Electrons are attracted to positively charged subatomic particles, also known as protons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Silicon has 14 electons in it's different orbitals.
                </p>
                <h2 class="subtitle">Protons</h2>
                <p>
                    A proton is a positively charged subatomic particle that is in the nucleus of an atom.
                    Protons determine the atomic number of an atom, and are attracted to electrons as
                    they're positively charged particles. Protons determine the amount of electrons needed
                    in an atom for it to have no charge, determining it's chemical properties. They also determine
                    the atomic mass number of an atom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Silicon has 14 protons in it's nucleus.
                </p>
                <h2 class="subtitle">Neutrons</h2>
                <p>
                    Neutrons are subatomic particles that do not have any charge. They are in the nucleus of
                    an atom, and they help to determine the atomic mass number of an atom. Neutrons are what determine
                    the isotope of an atom, which does not affect the electron count. The amount of neutrons determine
                    whether or not an atom is unstable or stable. Unstable atoms are atoms that display what is called
                    radioactivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Silicon has 14 neutrons in it's nucleus.

                <h2 class="subtitle">What Makes Silicon Special</h2>
                <p>
                    Silicon is what is known as a semiconductor. It's conductive, but not a metal. 
                    It's conductivity can be controlled. It is used in most computer components
                    such as your phone, your computer, your internet router, etc.
                    Silicon is the backbone of modern day technology, and that differs it
                    from the other atom families.
                </p>
