          Hello! I am Noah Shanaberger. Welcome to my little place on the
          interwebs. I love computers, science, and anything remotely technical really.
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing code is a personal passion of mine. 
            While I may not be the most creative artistically speaking, I have a love for writing code.
            To me, code can be considered an art form. While I am yet to be the best, I always try to work on my craftsmenship and improve.
            Backend software, databases, learning about algorithms, anything computers, enthrals me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a gander at my marvelous use of not pushing to Github enough,
          I don't mind. Seriously I do need to get into the habit of publishing endeavours on there, and here.
