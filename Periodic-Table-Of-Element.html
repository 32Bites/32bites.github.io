                        Antoine Lavoisier was known for identifying Oxygen (O), and Hydrogen (H). He also had also created a list of the
                        known elements at the time, 33 elements, and organized them based on whether or not they were metals or nonmetals 
                        (metalloids were included).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        John Newlands ordered the elements in order of atomic mass. After Newlands had noticed similarities in every 
                        eighth element, he created his Law of Octaves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lothar Meyer created a periodic table of 28 elements. He had organized this periodic table based up the atom's
                        valence shell.

                    <p>
                        Dmitri Mendeleev organized a periodic table into verticle columns according to the elements' similarities.
                        He would then leave gaps for "missing" elements and attempt to predict their properties. His predictions
                        were in fact mostly accurate.

                    <p>
                        Henry Moseley had discovered the elements were different not in atomic weight, but rather in atomic number.
                        He would go on to reorganize the periodic table to create the modern day periodic Table.

                        The periodic table is grouped into rows and columns. Withing these rows, we have what are called period.
                        Periods share an energy level, an as you increase the atomic number, you fill up that energy level with
                        each new element. Each group ends when you fill the energy level, creating a noble gas. As you fill
                        these energy levels, the fill up what are called orbitals. Orbitals are regions of probability, where there
                        is a 50/50 chance that there is an electron in that orbital. Orbitals have 3D wave functions which describe
                        the space and complicated shapes they can end up making. When you fill the energy level, you fill all of the
                        orbitials in that energy level. The outer "shell", or energy level of electrons is called the valence shell.
                        This valence shell determines the chemical properties of the element when it is not an ion. Usually elements 
                        group together on the periodic table, where they have the same, or similar amount of electrons in the valence
                        shell, making them behave relatively similarly. While the transition metals don't entirely follow this rule, 
                        as their groups have varying amounts of valence electrons, they still all behave similarly. These groups,
                        form as the columns on the periodic table.

                        Atomic Radius is the distance between the nucleuses of a compound of an element bonded to itself. Atomic Radius
                        decreases as atomic number increases. It also decreases as period decreases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ionic Radius is the distance between the nucleus and the outer electron shell of an ion. Ionic Radius increases
                        as the period number increases, but decreases as the atomic number increases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ionization Energy is how much energy is needed to pull an electron from an atom. Ionization Energy increases as 
                        atomic number increases, and as period number decreases.

                    <p>
                        Electronegativity is the tendency for an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons. Electronegativity increases
                        as atomic number increases, and as period number decreases.
